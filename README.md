# Small Social Media App

In this project I made small social media app with React.js and Typescript, I use Redux Toolkit Query for calling API from another developer that’s support the main features of social media apps, also make
infinite scroll pagination in home page for more performance.

**Note**: The API that I use in this project is public and any one can use it and post his own content on it,
soo I’m not responsible to any bad content will posted by other users.
